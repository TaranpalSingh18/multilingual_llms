      "Reason:The sentence translates to \"Sita's conduct is so spotless that nobody can point a finger at her.\"  The phrase \"point a finger at\" is used metaphorically to mean accuse or criticize.  There's no direct literal meaning of physically pointing a finger. The sentence highlights Sita's impeccable character and virtue.  The cultural context adds weight, as Sita is a highly respected figure in Hindu mythology known for her purity and devotion.  There's no specific Punjabi idiom used, although the metaphorical use of \"point a finger\" is a common expression across many languages.\n",

It implies a deep, protective, and ever-present concern that goes beyond mere physical sight.  There's a cultural element present, reflecting the valued role of parents and the importance placed on parental care in Punjabi culture.  The sentence doesn't contain a fixed idiom, but uses a common figurative expression to convey the meaning.\n",

The sentence's structure is straightforward subject-verb-object. There's no obvious idiom or metaphorical use beyond the implicit understanding that \"dry year\" implies the negative consequences of drought. The dryness of the year is a direct result of the drought, not a figurative representation of something else.\n",

There's no direct idiom, but the phrase functions metaphorically, implying a hidden meaning beyond the literal act of \"teaching\" (ustaadiyaan). The speaker is challenging Raj's pretentiousness.

The sentence implies a lack of foresight or planning leading to a missed opportunity or a negative outcome. There is a metaphorical meaning; \"traps\" aren't necessarily literal physical traps, but represent challenges or difficulties. The structure is straightforward, describing an action (leaving traps) and its cause (lack of wisdom).

This is a metaphorical expression; the dust isn't literally flying because of a physical sway but rather represents the upheaval caused by the escape. The sentence's meaning relies on the cultural context of family honor and reputation within a community.  There's no single idiom, but the phrase \"ਦੋ ਹਾਥੇ ਨਿਕਲ ਜਾਣ\" functions idiomatically to convey the impact of the escape.\n",

It's a metaphorical expression signifying a deep emotional impact, a feeling of awe, wonder, or intense emotional response evoked by the artistry.  The \"goosebumps\" metaphor is used to describe the overwhelming feeling that went beyond the mere visual appreciation.

This carries a strong cultural connotation, highlighting the societal value placed on having resources and social standing.  The loss of respect isn't merely about physical nakedness, but about the loss of social status and the subsequent lack of dignity accorded to someone impoverished.

      "📩 Gemini reply:\n",
      "Reason: The sentence translates to \"Because of the care of my parents, my head is dizzy/lightheaded.\"  The literal meaning is straightforward. However,  \"ਸਿਰ ਚਤੁਆ ਹੋਇਆ ਹੈ\" (sir chatua hoiya hai) can be interpreted metaphorically.  While literally meaning \"head is dizzy,\" it can imply being overwhelmed with love, gratitude, or even spoiled by excessive parental care. The cultural context plays a role;  excessive parental care is sometimes associated with over-pampering, leading to a spoiled child.  There's no established idiom present, although the metaphorical interpretation leans on the cultural understanding of parental care and its potential impact.\n",

      "Reason:The sentence literally translates to \"Only when one stone is lifted, the next one is understood.\"  However, this is clearly metaphorical.  It suggests that understanding often comes incrementally, revealing itself as one overcomes obstacles or solves individual problems. The image of lifting stones evokes a sense of effort and gradual progress.  There isn't a readily identifiable, fixed Punjabi idiom here, but the sentence functions as a proverb-like statement.

      "Reason:The sentence describes the stress caused by rising inflation (\"ਵੱਢ ਰਹੀ ਮਹੰਗਾਈ\").  The phrase \"ਸਮਾਂ ਆਈ ਚਲਾਈ ਹੀ ਹੁੰਦੀ ਹੈ\" is the core meaning.  A literal translation would be something like \"time keeps moving/passing.\" However, the context implies a metaphorical meaning:  no matter how much stress inflation causes, time continues regardless. It suggests a sense of helplessness against the relentless march of time and the economic hardships.  There's no single, readily identifiable Punjabi idiom, but the expression \"ਸਮਾਂ ਆਈ ਚਲਾਈ ਹੀ ਹੁੰਦੀ ਹੈ\" functions idiomatically in conveying the passage of time and the inevitability of its flow, especially in the face of adversity.\n",

The second part, \"ਸਭ ਉਸ ਦੀ ਇਜ਼ਤ ਕਰਦੇ ਹਨ,\" directly states that everyone respects him, reinforcing the metaphorical meaning of the first part.

This evokes a sense of admiration that goes beyond simple appreciation.

      "📩 Gemini reply:\n",
      "Reason:The sentence translates to \"Sundar's father had been ill for days—he passed away with a smile on his face.\"  The phrase \"ਹੱਸਦੇ ਉਹ ਅੱਖਾਂ ਮੀਟ ਗਏ\" (hassde uh akkhan meet gaye) literally means \"smiling, he closed his eyes,\" but it's used figuratively to describe a peaceful death.  There's no direct idiom, but the description of death with a smile conveys a sense of serenity and acceptance, which is a culturally nuanced way of portraying death.\n",

      "📩 Gemini reply:\n",
      "Reason:The sentence describes a situation where the flow of creative inspiration (\"ras\") stops and the mind becomes blocked.  The phrase \"ਅੰਗੜੀ ਪਲਾਉਣੀ ਹੱਥ ਮਾਰਦਾ ਹੈ\" (angari plauni hath marda hai) literally means \"he puts his hand to the ring/circle of the cooking fire\".  However, this is not a literal act of cooking.  It metaphorically implies resorting to desperate or last-resort measures to reignite creativity or inspiration, potentially even something risky or harmful (like tampering with a fire). The imagery suggests a state of frustration and the seeking of a quick, possibly unconventional solution.  There's a cultural element here, referencing a common cooking setup in rural Punjabi contexts. The connection between blocked creativity and resorting to drastic measures is a universal concept.\n",

      "📩 Gemini reply:\n",
      "Reason:The sentence describes a societal shift where traditional gender roles are reversed.  \"ਉਲਟੀ ਗੰਗਾ ਵਾਹਿ ਰਹੀ ਹੈ\" (ulti gannga vah rehī hai) is a metaphorical expression meaning \"things are upside down\" or \"the world is turned on its head.\"  It uses the imagery of a river flowing backward (an impossibility) to represent a reversal of the expected order. The rest of the sentence gives concrete examples of this reversal: women holding historically male-dominated jobs and men taking on childcare responsibilities at home. There's no single word or phrase that acts as an idiom; the idiomatic expression is the entire phrase \"ਉਲਟੀ ਗੰਗਾ ਵਾਹਿ ਰਹੀ ਹੈ\".\n",

The sentence describes a literal physical symptom of illness. The phrase \"ਸਾਹ ਸੱਤ ਹੀ ਨਹੀਂ ਰਹਿ ਰਿਹਾ\" (sah satt hee nahi reh raha) literally means \"breath is not even remaining,\" which directly conveys the difficulty in breathing.\n",

    "You are an expert in Punjabi language and culture, specifically adept at understanding and interpreting Punjabi idioms. Your task is to analyze a given Punjabi sentence, identify if it contains an idiom, and then determine the underlying user intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to identify intent from a Punjabi idiomatic sentence, following a step-by-step reasoning process. Notice the format of the final intent:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Punjabi Sentence:** 'ਰਤਾ! ਤੂੰ ਮੇਰੇ ਨਾਲ ਹਮਦਰਦੀ ਨਾ ਕਰ, ਮੈਂ ਤੇਰੀ ਅਸਲੀਅਤ ਜਾਣਦਾ ਹਾਂ।' \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n",
    "1.  **Identify Idiom:** The sentence contains the Punjabi idiom \"ਹਮਦਰਦੀ ਨਾ ਕਰ\" (hamdardee naa kar).\n",
    "2.  **Literal Meaning:** \"ਹਮਦਰਦੀ ਨਾ ਕਰ\" literally translates to \"don't sympathize.\"\n",
    "3.  **Idiomatic Meaning:** The idiomatic meaning of \"ਹਮਦਰਦੀ ਨਾ ਕਰ\" in this context, especially when paired with \"ਮੈਂ ਤੇਰੀ ਅਸਲੀਅਤ ਜਾਣਦਾ ਹਾਂ\" (I know your reality), is a rejection of false sympathy, implying the speaker sees through manipulative or insincere gestures.\n",
    "4.  **Contextual Interpretation:** The speaker is telling someone not to show sympathy, because the speaker already knows their true nature. This implies a rejection of insincere pity or a demand for authenticity, often stemming from a perceived manipulative intent. The user is conveying a strong dismissal of someone's pretense of sympathy, indicating they understand the person's true, likely negative, intentions.\n",
    "5.  **Determine User Intent:** To act out of knowing someone's true intentions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, apply the same step-by-step reasoning to identify the intent of the following Punjabi sentence. Provide your response by clearly labeling each step's output. Ensure your final \"Determine User Intent\" is a single, clear intent label, preferably starting with \"To\" followed by a verb, aligning with the examples provided in your dataset.\n",

    "**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n",
    "1.  **Identify Idiom:** The sentence contains the Punjabi idiom \"ਅੱਗ ਦੇ ਭਾਅ ਹੋ ਗਈ ਹੈ\".\n",
    "2.  **Literal Meaning:** \"ਅੱਗ ਦੇ ਭਾਅ ਹੋ ਗਈ ਹੈ\" literally translates to \"has become the price of fire.\"\n",
    "3.  **Idiomatic Meaning:** The idiomatic meaning of \"ਅੱਗ ਦੇ ਭਾਅ ਹੋ ਗਈ ਹੈ\" is \"to become extremely expensive,\" \"to be unaffordable,\" or \"to have sky-high prices.\"\n",
    "4.  **Contextual Interpretation:** Everything has become incredibly costly. The rhetorical question \"what should poor people do?\" emphasizes the dire impact of these high prices on the poor. The user is conveying a lament about economic hardship and helplessness.\n",
    "5.  **Determine User Intent:** To complain about high prices and economic hardship\n",

    "**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n",
    "1.  **Identify Idiom:** The sentence contains the Punjabi idiom \"ਅੱਖਾਂ ਤੇਰ ਲੈਣਾ\".\n",
    "2.  **Literal Meaning:** \"ਅੱਖਾਂ ਤੇਰ ਲੈਣਾ\" literally translates to \"to turn one's eyes.\"\n",
    "3.  **Idiomatic Meaning:** The idiomatic meaning of \"ਅੱਖਾਂ ਤੇਰ ਲੈਣਾ\" in this context is \"to look away surreptitiously to copy,\" or \"to cheat by glancing at someone else's work.\"\n",
    "4.  **Contextual Interpretation:** The phrase \"in school days, many times...is common\" combined with the idiom about cheating implies that it's a common behavior in school to copy from others during tests. The user is making a general observation about this common practice.\n",
    "5.  **Determine User Intent:** To describe a common occurrence/behavior\n",

    "**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n",
    "1.  **Identify Idiom:** The sentence contains the Punjabi idiom \"ਇੱਕ ਮੂੰਹ ਹੋ ਜਾਈਏ\".\n",
    "2.  **Literal Meaning:** \"ਇੱਕ ਮੂੰਹ ਹੋ ਜਾਈਏ\" literally translates to \"become one mouth.\"\n",
    "3.  **Idiomatic Meaning:** The idiomatic meaning of \"ਇੱਕ ਮੂੰਹ ਹੋ ਜਾਈਏ\" is \"to be united,\" \"to speak with one voice,\" or \"to act in unison.\"\n",
    "4.  **Contextual Interpretation:** The sentence emphasizes the current need for people to forget their differences and become united to confront an enemy. The user is urging for solidarity and collective action against a common threat.\n",
